- need to pivot - new plan:
- no jquery plugin
- works like dummyimage.com, only the php draws from a database of standard_resoultion data that is created by a cron
- each img src is a unique request
- server uses request to deliver a cropped jpg
- using this technique, is it now possible to log in through server? dantepassera could follow several quality accounts, and the results could be culled from those
	- that would allow me to offer limited keywording.  Offer several, e.g. architecture, cars, food, people


- jquery plugin to get instagram image and apply clip to 'img .instaholder'
initialize
- pass in one user name or keyword for all images, or user name / keyword per img? Do it global for now. Per image can be in the update.

get image from instagram api
- get img element href attr
- parse href attr for username or keyword
- request instagram image url from api
- set href attr to url
	- need to handle api failure or no image returned

apply clip
- get img element width and height
- adjust clip values accordingly

* if !doLocal, but server is unreachable, doLocal
