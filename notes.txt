Plan
	- jQuery plugin
	- initializing plugin (with no parameter, tag, or user name) queries instagram api and saves image urls to session variable
	- if possible crop images straight from instagram url and serve to page where requested
	- might have to save image from api to server, crop, serve, then delete.  Not ideal.
